## 📖 Description
The Physiological Debt Accumulation Engine helps you understand your sleep better. It models sleep as a process of recovering from a "debt" rather than just a nightly goal. By analyzing your unique physiological traits and environmental stresses, it predicts how much sleep you need, tracks your sleep debt, and shows how stress adds up. This tool helps you see patterns before they lead to fatigue.

## 🚀 Getting Started
